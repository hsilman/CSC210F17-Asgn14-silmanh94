Towers of Hanoi Animation using Tower Stacks

Assignment for class to implement Towers of Hanoi in Android.

I was having a huge problem attempting to create the disks as objects, so I decided to scrap it and go with the path I had started.

I created Stack<Tower> structures to represent each peg(3 total). This was I just had to worry about 3 objects rather than a ton.

I did the display of moves in a listview, and made the logic seperate from the actual animation.

Everything up to doing the animation was a piece of cake. Figuring that out took all the work.
